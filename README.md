# WikipediaDegree
This project will contain the famous "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" web scraper. A project i encountered while reading "Web Scraping with Python" by "Ryan Mitchell".

As done by Ryan Mitchell, i will be adopting the same method and treat this as a steping stone in my journey of learning web scraping.

### Currently i am reading the book, and completed chapter 3 where i found this project idea. So it will contain the initial progess only.
